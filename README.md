# Awesome LLMs for Privacy

This is a collection of papers and projects related to the use of LLMs for privacy that I curate for my research.
The focus is **not** on training data privacy (e.g., membership inference attacks, data extraction), but rather on privacy applications powered by LLMs.
These are all the papers that I have personally read/skimmed and found interesting.
I categorize them based on their goals (e.g., detection vs anonymization) and further tag them as follows:
- `CO` (constructive) if they are building something
- `EV` (evaluation) if they are evaluating/benchmarking
- `PO` (position) if they are primarily presenting a position or opinion
- `CI` if they involve the Contextual Integrity theory.

Please feel free to open a pull request if you would like to share an interesting paper that uses LLMs for privacy.
I will try to read and update the list whenever I have the time.
